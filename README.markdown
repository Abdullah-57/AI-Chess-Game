# Console-Based Chess Game with AI Opponent

This repository contains the implementation of a console-based chess game. The game allows a human player (white) to compete against an AI opponent (black), supporting all standard chess rules, including castling, en passant, pawn promotion, checkmate, and stalemate.

---

## 🌐 Project Overview

**Objective**: Develop a Python-based chess game with a human player interface and an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, adhering to standard chess rules and providing a user-friendly console experience.

---

## 🌟 Features

### Board Initialization

🔹 **ChessBoard Class**: Initializes an 8x8 board with standard starting positions (white pieces on ranks 1-2, black on 7-8).\
🔹 **Representation**: Uses uppercase (P, N, B, R, Q, K) for white, lowercase (p, n, b, r, q, k) for black, and '.' for empty squares.

- Tracks game state (current player, move history, en passant, castling, move counters).

### Move Generation

- Generates legal moves for pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings.
- Supports special moves: castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- Filters moves to prevent the king from being left in check.

### Move Execution

- Updates the board for standard and special moves (e.g., castling moves rook, en passant captures pawn).
- Handles pawn promotion with user choice (Q, R, B, N).
- Maintains castling availability, en passant targets, and move counters.

### Check and Game State Detection

- Detects check, checkmate, and stalemate conditions.
- Validates moves by checking if squares are under attack.

### AI Decision-Making

🔹 **ChessAI Class**: Uses Minimax with alpha-beta pruning (depth 3) to select the best move.\
🔹 **Evaluation Function**: Scores based on material, center control, pawn structure, mobility, and king safety.

- Ensures competitive play for casual games.

### Game Loop and User Interaction

- Alternates between human (white) and AI (black) turns.
- Accepts moves in algebraic notation (e.g., e2e4).
- Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs and supports quitting.
- Displays the board and game statistics in a formatted console UI.

## 📊 Results

🔹 **Correct Board Setup**: Initializes and displays the board with algebraic notation.\
🔹 **Move Validation**: Supports all chess moves, including special cases (e.g., Scholar’s Mate: e4, e5, Bc4, Qh5, Qf7#).\
🔹 **Game State Detection**: Accurately identifies check, checkmate, and stalemate.\
🔹 **AI Performance**: Responds to common openings and delivers checkmate in simple positions.\
🔹 **User Interaction**: User-friendly with clear prompts and error handling.\
🔹 **Robustness**: Handles edge cases (invalid inputs, promotions, draws) without crashing.

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

🔹 **Move Validation Efficiency**: Uses deep copies for move validation, which may slow down in complex positions.\
🔹 **AI Strength**: Limited to depth 3, potentially missing deeper tactics.\
🔹 **Halfmove Clock**: May need refinement for strict FIDE rule compliance.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

🔹 **Python**: v3.8 or later

### Setup

- **Clone the Repository**:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/chess-game-ai.git
  cd chess-game-ai
  ```

- **Install Dependencies**:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## 📖 Usage

- Launch the game with `python src/main.py`.
- Enter moves in algebraic notation (e.g., e2e4) as the white player.
- The AI (black) responds automatically.
- Use prompts to select pawn promotion pieces or quit the game.
- View the board and game status after each move.
